What are the potential relationships between different possible tables ?

1NF includes everything, then we separate every possible dependencies into new tables. 
then new tables would have 1 to 1, 1 to many, many to many relationships with each other. 
in the 2NF we seperated 1NF into several tables, and connected them with foreign keys. 
in 3NF we seperated 2NFs until to root so that there is no Transitive Dependency.
then we connected them with foreign keys.
